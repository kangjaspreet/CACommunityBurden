# California Community Burden

The Community Burden of Disease (CBD) is an evolving platform to view and explore detailed disease/condition burden and Social Determinants of Health data on multiple levels of geographic granularity in order to answer and generate questions, both simple and complex. 

The code and system are written/structured to useable by States and Counties throughout the United Statesâ€”with any State or County using their own structured input file of events (e.g. deaths), and the CBD system supplying underlying population data, Social Determinants of Health data, and all the processing, calculations, and tools to generate a range of interactive displays of multiple rate and count measures.  The list of disease conditions is based on the Global Burden of Disease system, modified for local public health priorities.

This California State implementation of the CBD, The California Community Burden of Disease and Cost Engine (CCB), currently includes detailed death data and multiple associated measures (e.g. age-adjusted cause-specific Years of Life Lost rates) for 2001 to 2015 at the census tract, community (California Medical Service Study Areas), county, and statewide levels.  The CCB also includes a small set of Social Determinants of Health, and describes their correlations with death outcomes, as a pilot for more robust functionality in this area.  Other short-term road map plans include the addition of burden of disease and costs (charges) based on California Hospital Discharge data, automated report generation, and more.

Other Info:

* A health burden visualization tool; a lens into the relation of place and health disparities
* Designed for State Health Department programs, Local Health Departments, and community partners; specifically for epidemiologic analysis and systematic scientific insight for allocation of resources, evaluation of interventions, and program planning 
* Clear place-based mortality measure data, to address specific queries;
* Platform for hypothesis generation and testing; 
* Rich and multi-level data set/system for modeling and predictive analytics.
* Pilot component of the Calfornia Department of Public Health Ecosystem of Data Sharing, demonstrating automated and integrated data processing, analytics, and visualization.
* Nimble modular development, with goal to share tools/resources with outside partners (counties and other states).
